title: "Tiling"
---

An xarray tile server provides image tiles via the [XYZ Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map) and [OGC Tiles](https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-057/20-057.html) API specifications.

The tile server approach relies on the [`rio_tiler.XarrayReader`](https://github.com/cogeotiff/rio-tiler/blob/main/rio_tiler/io/xarray.py) library which includes the `tile` function. This module supports tiling of anything that is xarray-readable, so a tile server using this library can render tiles from Zarr stores as well as netCDF4/HDF5 and other formats. An example API infrastructure can be found in [titiler-multidim](https://github.com/developmentseed/titiler-multidim). Please note this library is still in development and is not intended for production use at this time.

Users can preview their zarr data using the map form and preview tool at [https://staging.openveda.cloud/api/multidim/WebMercatorQuad/map](https://staging.openveda.cloud/api/multidim/WebMercatorQuad/map).
